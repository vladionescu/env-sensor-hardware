Based on lcd_16x2.py from http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2012/07/16x2-lcd-module-control-using-python/.

Used to control a SparkFun 16x2 OLED display utilizing the RS0010 controlled instead of the popular HD44780.

This requires RPi.GPIO, a poorly named package found in PyPi and Raspbian's Apt.

[RPi.GPIO from PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO)

or

```
$ sudo apt install python-rpi.gpio
```
